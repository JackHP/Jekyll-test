I am a Full Stack Developer with professional industry and software development experience gained through working at an American multinational software corporation - Autodesk. 

I have front-end experience in Angular and various charting frameworks. On the back-end I have extensively used Python and Django, including the Django Rest Framework to build a REST API. I am proficient in CSS, HTML and SQL. Most of my programming skills have in fact been been self-taught, including, most recently, Angular. 

I really enjoy coding because it allows me to make full use of my problem solving skills, to collaborate, to be innovative and creative. It is also challenging, yet highly rewarding with a visible product as a result of my efforts. I feel like I have made something. There is always more to learn and I enjoy learning.

I have a keen eye for detail and this has allowed me to succeed in multiple industries. From the stringent requirements of the industrial manufacturing industry to the cleanliness and ease of use required for web-based software solutions, my experience has given me the ability to work across multiple sectors to an exacting standard.

I enjoy working with people and understanding their requirements from the broadest sense of what they are ultimately looking for, the big picture, to the minutest of details. I believe knowledge should be shared and have enjoyed teaching others in my previous roles.
