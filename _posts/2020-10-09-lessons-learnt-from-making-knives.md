## Lesson 1: Manufacturing Process Affects Material Properties

A few years ago I started making chef knives by hand. It's a long process that requires full attention throughout, as even a small lapse in concentration can lead to an irreparable blade.

The stock steel comes as large flat sheets and from here, blanks are water jet cut. Early on I realised that there were problems with simply taking one of these blanks and grinding it to shape. When I sent some of them off to be hardened I got a call back from the heat treater. He told me that they had all warped and explained to me that this is because the steel would have originally been wound into a large coil from the steel mill and that the process of unwrapping it induced stress into the material and this was now causing the knife to spring back into that original starting shape.
